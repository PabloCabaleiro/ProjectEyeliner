## Extraction and visualization of the cornea-lens relation in AS-OCT images

Irregularities in the cornea hinder vision and worsen the quality of life of patients. 
Currently, for many of these cases, rehabilitation is possible through the use of special contact lenses that correct the structure of the 
cornea. However, its application requires a process of adaptation and a follow-up by the expert of the evolution to the patient. 
This follow-up is done through manual analysis of Optical Coherence Tomography of the Anterior Segment (AS-OCT). 
The expert manually studies the relationship between the lens and the cornea to detect anomalies. 
This methodology, besides requiring a lot of time from the expert, does not allow objective valuation or obtaining metrics that require 
complex processing of the information.

The present project aims to define the optimal metrics for the study of the relationship between the lens and the cornea. 
On the other hand, it will develop a methodology for its automatic extraction from AS-OCT images and an intuitive visualization 
method for experts.
